# Cplusplus-Program

## Project Summary

This program was created in order to show how C++ can easily create a working clock. It also displays how creating functions can make your program much more readable. I utilized function declarations so that `main` can be left at the top and therefore the general flow of the program can be seen first. I feel that I excelled at creating readable code that any programmer could understand. I made good use of comments and my intentions are clear throughout my code. My code could easily be added to, or maintained by others thanks to my use of comments.

## Room for Improvement

One of the biggest drawbacks of my code is that it will only function for Windows users because it utilizes `windows.h` in order to access `GetAsyncKeyState`. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out a different solution for the menu that would work on all platforms. I ultimately ran out of time and decided to finish the program only supporting Windows. I am sure that I could find a solution though if I dedicated enough time to it.

## Biggest Challenges

As I have stated above, one of the biggest challenges for me was coming up with a solution for the menu that would allow the menu to appear upon a key press. The easiest solution was `getchar()` which was too sloppy in my opinion. I was able to come up with the current solution by utilizing the internet and simply searching my questions on google. I find that with programming, somebody has often already asked the question I have. I found many different posts asking for help with a similar problem and was able to come up with the final solution that I submitted.

## Skills Developed

When I was writing this code I was just learning about how to implement functions in C++. I have used functions previously in other languages but this was the first big project I worked on after learning about functions in C++. I found it very useful to declare my functions at the top of my code so that `main` could be seen first. In my opinion this made my code feel much more readable and professional. I also learned a method for calling code whenever the user presses a key which is a useful skill to have. Overall, I feel that this project helped me a lot with learning how to create clean and efficient code using C++.
